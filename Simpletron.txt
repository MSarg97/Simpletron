A program written in Simpletron Machine Language to add two integer values: 

1020                //reads the integer value entered by user into memory cell 20 
1021                //reads the integer value entered by user into memory cell 21
2020                //loads data from memory cell 20 into accumulator
3021                //adds accumulator data and data from memory cell 21 (the result is in accumulator)
2122                //Stores accumulator data into memory cell 22
1122                //prints data from memory cell 22 
-99999              //sentinel value, end of program
